# Reboot Into Windows Script

This script allows Linux users with GRUB as the bootloader to reboot directly into Windows with a single click. It automatically detects your Windows boot entry in GRUB and creates a desktop shortcut to reboot into Windows easily. This script works on most Linux distributions like Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch Linux, and more.

## Features

- **Automatically detects Windows boot entry**: The script identifies the Windows boot option in your GRUB configuration.
- **Creates a Desktop Shortcut**: A `.desktop` file is created for easy execution via GUI. The shortcut works for GNOME, KDE, XFCE, and other major desktop environments.
- **Works on multiple Linux distributions**: Compatible with Debian-based (Ubuntu), Fedora, CentOS, Arch Linux, and others.
- **No extra dependencies**: Does not require any additional software outside the basic Linux environment and GRUB bootloader.

## Desktop Environment Support

- The script automatically detects your desktop environment and adjusts the `.desktop` file accordingly.
- It works on GNOME, KDE, XFCE, MATE, and others. The script marks the `.desktop` file as trusted for GNOME-based environments (using `gio set`) and sets it executable for others (using `chmod +x`).

## Requirements

- **GRUB bootloader**: This script works only if GRUB is used as the bootloader. It’s compatible with most Linux distributions using GRUB.
- **Sudo privileges**: The script requires root (`sudo`) access to modify GRUB and create system files.

## Installation Instructions

1. **Download the Script**

    Navigate to the folder where the script is located:

2. **Run the Script**

    Run the script using the terminal by opening a new Terminal Window and dragging the script into the Terminal:

    The script will ask for your password to make necessary system changes (like updating GRUB and creating files in `/opt`).

3. **After the Installation**

    The Script will automatically place a shortcut on your desktop, Allow the Shortcut to be executed and double click the shortcut to now run it.

## How the Script Works

1. **Step 1: Detect Windows GRUB Entry**  
    The script scans your GRUB configuration file (`/boot/grub/grub.cfg` or `/boot/grub2/grub.cfg`) for any Windows boot entries.

2. **Step 2: Create Reboot Script**  
    It creates a script at `/opt/reboot-into-windows` that tells GRUB to boot into Windows and then reboots the system.

3. **Step 3: Create Desktop Shortcut**  
    A `.desktop` file is created on the user's desktop, which can be double-clicked to reboot into Windows.

4. **Step 4: Set Permissions**  
    It sets up the appropriate sudo permissions to allow the script to run without entering the password every time.

## Usage

- After installation, you’ll see a new shortcut on your desktop named **"Reboot into Windows"**.
- To reboot into Windows, simply double-click the shortcut.
- If prompted, enter your password for sudo access (if not set up for passwordless sudo).

## Customizing the Script

You can manually adjust the script if:

- **You use a different bootloader**: The script is designed for GRUB, and if you're using something else (like `systemd-boot` or `rEFInd`), you'll need to modify the script.
- **You want to change the GRUB timeout**: Edit the line setting the GRUB timeout in `/etc/default/grub`.

## Troubleshooting

- **No Windows entry found**: Ensure that your GRUB configuration contains a valid Windows entry. If not, you may need to repair or update your GRUB.
- **Desktop shortcut not working**: If the `.desktop` file doesn’t appear or doesn’t work, try marking it as executable manually:

    ```bash
    chmod +x /home/username/Desktop/reboot-into-windows.desktop
    ```

- This script leverages GRUB to identify the Windows boot entry. Thanks to the GRUB project for providing such an accessible way to interact with the bootloader.
- This Script was Generated by Chat-GPT based on the instructions provided by this webpage https://rastating.github.io/creating-a-reboot-into-windows-button-in-ubuntu/ this script reduces the all the steps needed into one single simple script that handles all that.
